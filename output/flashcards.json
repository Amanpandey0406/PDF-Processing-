      "question": "What are the physiological changes that occur during acute MR?",
      "answer": "During Acute MR, normal or reduced compliance of the left atrium leads to a marked increase in LA pressure, potentially causing acute pulmonary edema. The Acute MR doesn't provide enough time for the left atrium to adapt to the regurgitant volume overload. As a result, left atrium, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary artery pressures significantly increase, often leading to acute pulmonary edema."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the blood in the left ventricle (LV) in patients with Mitral Regurgitation (MR)?",
      "answer": "In patients with MR, some of the blood in the LV is pumped forward through the aortic valve (forward stroke volume), and some is forced backward through the incompetent mitral valve (regurgitant stroke volume). The amount of blood that flows forward is determined in part by the left ventricular afterload."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does dilatation of the left atrium over time affect Mitral Regurgitation (MR)?",
      "answer": "Over time in MR, valvular dysfunction allows for adaptive dilatation of the left atrium, thinning of its wall, and an accompanying increase in left atrium compliance. This adapation helps to buffer the regurgitant volume from the left ventricle, resulting in lower elevation of left atrium pressures compared to acute MR."

      "question": "What happens during ventricular remodelling?",
      "answer": "Ventricular remodelling is the process where the structure of the heart changes due to the loss of myocardial cells (apoptosis) and fibrosis. This makes the myocardium weaker and diminishes its capacity to generate force, leading to a decline in pumping capacity and ultimately heart failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process of decompensated cardiac failure?",
      "answer": "In decompensated cardiac failure, the compensatory mechanisms, which initially increase EDV and blood volume for better heart function, start to worsen the condition. The ventricular cavity size increases decreasing its ability to generate pressure, resulting in a decline in cardiac output (CO). This contributes to progressive heart failure."

    },
    {
      "question": "How do diuretics and positive inotropic drugs therapy affect ventricular remodelling?",
      "answer": "Diuretics reduce fluid overload by increasing urine output, thereby reducing the EDV.

    {
      "question": "What happens to the heart in case of myocardial damage following infarction?",
      "answer": "In the case of myocardial damage, such as that following a heart attack (infarction), the myocardium fails to contract adequately at a given volume, causing a decrease in cardiac output. This decreased function, if uncompensated, leads to heart failure."
